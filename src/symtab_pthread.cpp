/*
 * The pthread objects whose bionic layout the host does not share. Two of
 * them: pthread_attr_t, below, and pthread_mutex_t, further down.
 *
 * pthread_attr_t, because bionic's is 24 bytes and glibc's is 36.
 *
 * bionic (ILP32) declares the attribute object inline:
 *
 *     typedef struct {
 *       uint32_t flags;  void *stack_base;   size_t stack_size;
 *       size_t guard_size;  int32_t sched_policy;  int32_t sched_priority;
 *     } pthread_attr_t;                                  // 24 bytes
 *
 * glibc declares it as `union { char __size[36]; long __align; }`. The
 * generated bionic table binds pthread_attr_init straight to the host's, and
 * the host's zeroes all 36 bytes - into the 24 the game reserved.
 *
 * native_app_glue puts that object on the stack:
 *
 *     android_app_create():
 *         pthread_attr_t attr;                  // 24 bytes of frame
 *         pthread_attr_init(&attr);             // host writes 36
 *         pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);
 *         pthread_create(&app->thread, &attr, android_app_entry, app);
 *
 * so the twelve extra bytes land on whatever the compiler put after it -
 * here, the stack canary - and the process dies in __stack_chk_fail during
 * ANativeActivity_onCreate, before the game thread has done anything. Exactly
 * the same failure shape as clock_gettime in symtab_time.cpp, and just as
 * silent: nothing in the log mentions pthread.
 *
 * So the attribute object is kept in the game's layout on the game's stack,
 * and translated into a real host pthread_attr_t only at pthread_create.
 *
 * These entries come before the generated libc table in so_dynamic_libraries
 * so they win the lookup.

 * Mutexes, because bionic's pthread_mutex_t is one 32-bit word and glibc's is

 *
 * The game cannot own a real host mutex in the space it reserved, so
 * gmloader-next's bridge (thunks/libc/pthread.cpp) keeps the host mutex on the
 * heap and stores the pointer in that word. Sound - except for how it decides
 * whether a mutex has been created yet: it tests the word against zero, and
 * zero is only one of bionic's three static initialisers.
 *
 *     PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER             { 0      }

 *     PTHREAD_ERRORCHECK_MUTEX_INITIALIZER  { 0x8000 }
 *
 * A statically initialised *recursive* mutex therefore reaches the bridge
 * holding 0x4000, the bridge reads that as an already-allocated pointer, and
 * glibc dereferences address 0x4000.
 *
 * That is where Ice Rage died, before onCreate and before anything was logged:
 * the C++ runtime it links statically guards its function-local statics with
 *
 *     static pthread_mutex_t guard = PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
 *
 * (libicerage.so ships it at .data+0x1210c0, word = 0x4000), and the engine's
 * xt::ReflectType registration hits the first such static from an .init_array
 * constructor - so the fault happened during so_load_module, with the log
 * still showing nothing but "Linking libicerage.so...".
 *
 * Minigore 2 never tripped this: its build of the same engine has no
 * statically initialised recursive mutex, so every word the bridge ever saw
 * was 0.
 *
 * The word is therefore decoded here instead, and this table comes before the
 * generated libc one in so_dynamic_libraries, so these win the lookup.
 *
 * Only the four entry points libicerage.so actually imports are overridden;
 * pthread_mutex_trylock and friends are left to the bridge because the game
 * never calls them and an unused override is an untested one.
