# Ice Rage — PortMaster launcher.
#
# Modelled on ports/half-life/Half-Life.sh from PortMaster-New: same
# controlfolder probe, same control.txt / tasksetter / device_info.txt
# sourcing, same $GPTOKEYB + $TASKSET invocation, same "/$directory/ports"
# base. The differences are all forced by what this port is:
#
#   * armhf only. The game ships one native library, armeabi-v7a, and the
#     bionic ELF loader has to map it into a process of the same word size,
#     so there is no $DEVICE_ARCH switch here — the binary is always armhf.
#   * The game data is the user's own APK. It is never bundled with the port
#     and it is passed to the loader as argv[1].
#   * ICERAGE_DATA_DIR is where the engine writes its savegames. On Android
#     that is /data/data/<pkg>/files and it always exists before onCreate;
#     here it has to be created, because the engine treats a failed open of
#     its save directory as fatal rather than as "no save yet".

# control.txt and the files it pulls in live on the device, not in this repo,
# so shellcheck can neither follow them (SC1090/SC1091) nor see that they are
# what define $directory, $sdl_controllerconfig, $ESUDO, $GPTOKEYB and
# $TASKSET (SC2154). Every other class of finding stays on.

  Ice Rage - wrong game file

  That APK has no armeabi-v7a library
  inside, so there is nothing to run.

  Common causes:
    - it is an XAPK or APKM renamed
      to .apk (those are archives that
      hold the real APK inside)
    - it is a split install, arm64 only

  You need the plain single APK of
  net.mountainsheep.icerage

  Ice Rage - unexpected APK

  This port was built against the OUYA
  release of net.mountainsheep.icerage
  (v1.8, October 2013), and your file
  does not look like it.

  Other builds may still work, but the
  Play version is touch-only and this
  port drives the game as a controller.

  Starting anyway - if it crashes or
  the menus do not respond, this is the
